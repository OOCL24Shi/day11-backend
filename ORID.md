**Objective:** Today, we focused on integrating React for the front-end with Spring Boot on the back-end, learning how these technologies communicate effectively. Additionally, we were introduced to the fundamentals of cloud-native development and its role in building scalable applications.

**Reflective:** insightful

**Interpretive:** Understanding the interaction between React and Spring Boot provided clarity on full-stack application development, particularly in managing data flow between the front-end and back-end. The introduction to cloud-native concepts emphasized the importance of scalability, resilience, and containerization for modern software systems.

**Decision:** I plan to deepen my understanding of full-stack development by building small projects integrating React and Spring Boot, while also exploring cloud-native tools and practices to prepare for scalable application deployment.
